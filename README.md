# Astrophotography on SpIRIT
----------------------------

The [SpIRIT](https://spirit.research.unimelb.edu.au) nano satellite has a number of small
Raspberry Pi [Camera Module v2's](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-v2/)
on board.

This repo investigates the possibility of widefield astrophotography from Low Earth Orbit
using SpIRIT's cameras, and the potential for onboard image registration and stacking. These
cameras are part of SpIRIT's [Loris](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08399) payload.
