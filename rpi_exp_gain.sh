# Explore a range of exposure and gain settings on the raspberry pi camera v2

# The max digital gain on the imx219 sensor seems to be x8, beyond which some
# sort of digital gain seems to kick in - which will not improve anything

# Due to a jetson nano NVIDIA driver issue, the current max exposure on
# SpIRIT is 0.358s, despite the max exposure of the imx219 sensor being
# 11.76s. We explore both in case the driver on SpIRIT can be modified.
